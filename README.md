# Natural Language to SQL(Na2SQL): Extracting Insights from Databases using OpenaAI GPT3.5 and Llamaindex

Welcome to the Natural Language to SQL demo project using LlamaIndex! This application is designed to demonstrate the innovative use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in translating natural language queries into SQL queries, and fetching meaningful insights from a database.

### Demo Features
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Converts user-inputted natural language queries into accurate SQL queries.
- **Data Retrieval and Analysis**: Retrieves results from the database and interprets them to provide meaningful insights.
- **Accessibility**: Designed for users with no SQL background to easily interact with and extract insights from databases.

### Potential Enhancements
- Expansion to include more diverse data sources and databases.
- Advanced natural language processing for more intricate query handling.
